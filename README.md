## Context

Workshops play a crucial role in fostering learning and collaboration. Our application aims to streamline the workshop organization process, making it easier for organizers to manage participants, sessions, and materials. Whether you're a seasoned workshop host or just starting out, this API has got you covered!

## Technical Overview

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** We use **JDK 21**, tested with **Adoptium**, to power our application.
- **Database:** Our backend relies on a **PostgreSQL 13** database for data storage.
- **Build Tool:** We leverage **Gradle 8.7** for managing dependencies and building the project.
- **Spring Boot:** Our application is based on **Spring Boot 3.2.4**, which provides a robust framework for creating RESTful APIs.
- **Application Server:** Our application can run on Tomcat server that require version 10.1.24.

## Building and Running

To compile and run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have JDK 21 installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project root directory.
4. Execute the following command to compile the Java code :
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean compileJava
   ```
5. To run the application locally, either:
   Execute the main method in the Application class from your IDE.
   Use the Spring Boot Gradle Plugin :
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```
   For production, package the application as WAR and use a tomcat server

To run correctly the application with docker after you building it with tag workshop-organizer, run the following

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Configuration

You can configure the application with these environment variables

- SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: JDBC URI for DB access (ex. jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/mydatabase)
- SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: Database user name used by the application
- SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: Database user password used by the application

## Testing

We take testing seriously! To verify the correctness of our application, run the following command:

```bash
./gradlew clean test
```

During execution junit reports are generated in the `build/test-results/test` folder.

## Packaging

When youâ€™re ready to package the application for deployment, create a deployable WAR file:

```bash
./gradlew bootWar
```

The generated war file can be used with many application servers such as Tomcat, Wildfly...

## Publishing to GitLab Registry

To publish your application to a GitLab registry, follow these steps:

1. Set up your GitLab project.
2. Ensure you have the following environment variables configured:

   - GITLAB_PROJECT_ID: The ID of your GitLab project.
   - GITLAB_TOKEN_NAME: The name of the GitLab access token.
   - GITLAB_TOKEN: Your GitLab access token.

3. Execute the following command to publish your application:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew publish
   ```
   Remember to replace placeholders with actual values specific to your project.
